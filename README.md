# xworld2016

A repo for my workshop at X World 2016 "Bash For Beginners"

It contains a bunch of example scripts and the Markdown source and
reveal.js slideshow for the presentation.

The reveal.js slideshow is created using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org).
The exact pandoc command can be found in `pandoc.sh`.

The `slides.pdf` file is generated by running the slideshow in  a
browser with the query `?print-pdf` and then saving to PDF from the
print dialog. As the background doesn't print properly in the normal
slideshow the special version `print.html` has been created with the
command line `pandoc-print.sh` that doesn't include the background. So
to create the PDF the URL is
`http://localhost:8000/print.html?print-pdf` if you run `python -m
SimpleHTTPServer` in this directory. The `slides_notes.pdf` file is
generated using `Marked 2` and `Export as, Save PDF`.
